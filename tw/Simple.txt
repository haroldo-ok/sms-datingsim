I head to the library, to get some studying done.

The glasses girl is there, apparently waiting for me.

She's holding a package in her hands.
Glasses Girl: Here.

She says, and she hands me the package.

I take it from her, and open it.

It contains fresh homemade cookies. Ginger snaps, I think.
Glasses Girl: It's to thank you.

She points out... She's probably not used to this. Especially with guys.

I take one of them, and stick it in my mouth.

The taste is exquisite.

It's perhaps one of the best cookies I've ever tasted.

Of course it is. It's the only cookie I'd ever tasted that was made for me by a beutiful girl.

I tell her this... that it's delicious, not the girl part.

But I do let slip that if I could eat these every day, I'd be the happiest guy in the world.

At this, she can only blush.

:: pothole
I start running, and meet up with the sporty girl as she passes the street in front of my house.

We run together for several miles.

I think about how much I've improved in our time together.

And, although she probably won't admit it, I think she's improved as well.

I guess a little friendly competition is usually for the best.

A small yelp pulls me out of my thought.
Sporty Girl: Ow!

The sporty girl sits down, grabbing her ankle.

I ask her what happened.
Sporty Girl: I... hit a... pothole. Twisted my... ankle.

I wince in sympathy.

We wait a bit. I'm not sure what to do.

Finally, I ask her if she can walk on it.

She tries for a bit, but then winces in pain.
Sporty Girl: No, I don't think so.

I realize that we can't stay here.

And so, I crouch down and motion for her to climb up onto my back.
Sporty Girl: What are you doing?

I explain that she can't stay out in the middle of the street forever, and she won't get any help until I can get her home.

And the only way to do that is for me to carry her.

She accepts this, and climbs up onto my back.

She wraps her arms around my neck, and I place my hands underneath her to make a seat.

I stand up, and start carrying her home.

<<return>>


:: bookslide
I head to the library, to get some studying done.

The glasses girl is standing right by the entrance, putting a book back into a bookcase containing science books.

It looks quite old, and quite weak, as if it could break at any time.

Suddenly, I hear a loud crack come from the bookcase.

Without thinking, I throw myself between the girl and the bookcase, pushing her out of the way in the process.

As the shelves fail one by one, I'm hit with large textbooks on topics ranging from Astronomy to Zoology.

She's safe, but I'm knocked off my feet by the falling books.

Before the dust even settled, the girl with glasses realized what happened and asked:
Glasses Girl: Are you alright?

I tell her that I am, all the while rubbing a bruise left by a particularly large Physics book.
Glasses Girl: You saved me.

She points out. I shrug... I guess I did, but it's not like I'm a hero or anything.

She extends out her hand, I take it, and she helps me to get up.
Glasses Girl: Wow... Um...

She doesn't know what to say.

I suggest that we help clean up the mess, mostly to take her off the spot.

She agrees, and together we begin piling the books up into neat piles.

I'm out running again, when the sporty girl catches up to me.
Sporty Girl: Still at it?
Sporty Girl: Well, keep up the good work. One day you'll be as fast as me!
Sporty Girl: Well, maybe.


Today, however, I'm not about to let this stand unchallenged.

I break out into a run, and for the first time ever, I keep up with her.

We both run, neck and neck, me keeping up with her.

Finally, she starts slowing down, and we come to a stop together.
Sporty Girl: Not bad.

She pauses to catch her breath.
Sporty Girl: You've been practicing, and it really shows.
Sporty Girl: You've finally become fast enough to run with me.

I nod, accepting her praise.
Sporty Girl: We should do this more often... it's better to run with someone else, to keep the challenge up.

I nod again.
Sporty Girl: Well, shall we go?

I nod a third time, and we take off, running side by side.

:: introduction
I run to school, and make it to my seat just as the bell signalling the start of class rings.
Teacher: Before we start, I have an announcement to make.
Teacher: We will have two new students joining us. Girls, come on in.

Two girls walk in, and stand in front of the class.

They're twins.

Identical twins.

Identical black hair, and the same pretty face.

Despite that, it's still fairly easy to tell them apart.

The one on the left is wearing glasses.

Not too thick, but enough to let me know she probably reads alot of books.

If I look a little closely, I can find another difference.

The one on the right probably exercises a bit more.

I can tell by the muscle tone in her legs.

I realize that I'm staring at her legs, and quickly look up.

Suddenly, I realize that she's been talking for all this town.
Sporty Girl: ... to this town. And we hope to be friends with all of you.
Sporty Girl: Well, that's about it. Sis, do you have anything to say?

The girl with glasses pauses for a second, and then quickly says:
Glasses Girl: It's good to meet you all.

She stops, and goes back to not saying anything.
Teacher: Well, if that's all, you can take your seats and we can start the class.

They do, and our teacher begins his lecture.

I don't think anyone pays much attention to it, however.

:: borrow_pen
I head to the library, to get some studying done.

The glasses girl is there, but she's busy reading a book.

I decide not to disturb her, and instead start reading my own book.

Suddenly, I feel a tap on my shoulder.

I look up, and see the glasses girl standing right next to me.
Glasses Girl: Excuse me, but can I borrow your pen?
Glasses Girl: Mine ran out of ink.

I dig through my bag, to find the pen I had stashed there.

While I'm looking, I point out that she seems to come to the library alot.
Glasses Girl: Hm... I guess you're right.
Glasses Girl: There's so much stuff here, and I want to know about it all.
Glasses Girl: Surely, you must feel the same way, as you're here almost as much as I am.

I don't have the heart to tell her that I'm only here to study so that I don't fail out.

My hand brushes the pen, and I quickly pull it out and give it to her.
Glasses Girl: Thank you.

She says, and she goes back to studying.

:: sg_confess
I once again barely make it to class on time.

I sit down, at my desk, and put some of my books into it.

My hand brushes a folded sheet of paper, one I didn't remember putting in there.

It's a girl's handwriting... 'Meet me on the roof at lunch.'

That's all it says... no signature or anything.

Lunch is a few hours away, but the time passes like a blur.

It's all I can do to avoid racing up to the roof... but I give it some time anyway.

It wouldn't make sense for me to get there first.

I let two minutes elapse before leaving the classroom, and then slowly walk the flights of stairs up to the roof.

Standing there, I find the sporty girl.

She's leaning on a crutch.

I look at it for a second, and she notices that.
Sporty Girl: I went to the doctor, and he gave me this.
Sporty Girl: Looks like we won't be running together for a while.

I nod.
Sporty Girl: And that's why I asked you here.
Sporty Girl: I couldn't stand the though of not seeing you for a few weeks.

I search my feelings, and realize I feel the same way.
Sporty Girl: So I thought...

She doesn't say it... she doesn't need to.

We both know how we feel about each other.

And with that, we went from being running partners to partners in
     a deeper sense.

Now if I only knew her name...

I decide to go out for a run, to keep myself in shape.

As I'm running through the town, I see a girl.

She's one of the twins who transferred into my class.

She waves, and comes over to me.
Sporty Girl: I didn't know you were a runner.

I point out that I'm not really a runner... I just run a little bit at a time.

I ask her if she wants to run with me for a while.
Sporty Girl: As if! You couldn't keep up with me.

I point out that I probably can.
Sporty Girl: Well, let's see.

We set off running, but she quickly pulls past me.
Sporty Girl: See? Well, maybe we can try it again when you're a bit faster.
Sporty Girl: Until then, later.

Even though I'm jogging, she pulls away as if it is nothing.

She's holding what looks like a homemade lunch... big enough for two.

I look at it, then her, then remember what I had said after she made me the cookies.

Finally, I ask her... 'Does this mean?'

She nods. It's all the confirmation I need.

I sit down next to my new girlfriend... and together we start eating her lunch.

I'm probably the happiest guy in the world.

I once again barely make it to class on time.

I sit down, at my desk, and put some of my books into it.

I take the first one out, and read it.

It's a girl's handwriting... 'Meet me on the roof at lunch.'

That's all it says... no signature or anything.

I take a look at the second one, and it says the same thing.

Sure, the handwriting is a little different, but...

Lunch is a few hours away, but the time passes like a blur.

It's all I can do to avoid racing up to the roof... but I give it some time anyway.
    
I let two minutes elapse before leaving the classroom, and then slowly walk the flights of stairs up to the roof.

Standing there are the twins.

Both of them.

As in, the two notes came from the two twins.

I ask them what they are doing there, feigning ignorance.

Sporty Girl: Well, I invited you up here to confess to you...
Sporty Girl: ... and then I found out that my sister here was about to do the same thing.
Glasses Girl: ...I was...
Sporty Girl: When we found out, we were quite shocked, but after comparing notes, we decide what we're going to do...

I quickly run through the possibilities in my head.

The best cases involve them never talking to me again.

The worst cases involve me being thrown off the roof.

Both Girls: "We're going to share you!

Eh?

That wasn't something I considered.

Each of the girls grabs onto one of my arms.

I don't know what the future holds for us...

... and I don't know if this will work out.

But I do know that one day I will work up the courage to find out their names.
